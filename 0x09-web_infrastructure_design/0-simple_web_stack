In this one-server web infrastructure, we host a website accessible via www.foobar.com. The diagram illustrates the components of the server and the communication between the server and a client requesting foobar.com
EVENTS
REQUEST: The user enters a memorable URL and submits it from their favorite browser.
DNS RESOLUTION: The computer sends a DNS request to convert the human-readable URL to the website's actual IP address.
TCP CONNECTION: The computer establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the web server.
HTTP REQUEST: The computer is ready to send an HTTP request to the web server.
PROCESSING: The web server processes the HTTP request, generating the requested data. This data can be fetched from the database by the application server or accessed from the codebase.
HTTP RESPONSE: The data is prepared to be transmitted back to the user.
RENDERING: The browser displays the information received from the server.
INTERACTION: The user can interact with the content and trigger events within it.
ISSUES
SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE (SPOF)
A Single Point of Failure is a situation where a system relies on a single factor, and if that factor fails, the entire system can crash. In this structure, there are several SPOFs to consider
POWER SUPPLY: If the power supply relies on a single source, an outage can disrupt the entire system.
ISP SPOF: If the connection from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) stops, the connection between the computer and the server will cease.
CAPACITY OVERFLOW: With only one server receiving requests, it may become overwhelmed and unable to handle the load during traffic spikes.
DNS SPOOFING ATTACK: This consists of manipulating the Domain Name System (DNS) to redirect users to a malicious website. This not only poses a security threat but also creates a communication SPOF.
DOWNTIME: Deploying new code or performing server maintenance, including software updates, hardware maintenance, database maintenance, or configuration changes, may lead to service interruptions.
SCALING TRAFFIC: The potential for a sudden surge in traffic can disrupt service since there's only one server to handle requests.
A robust infrastructure design addresses these SPOFs to ensure reliable and uninterrupted service.
