The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. These layers define the communication process from the physical transmission of signals to the application-level interaction between software applications. Here's a brief overview of each layer:

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1):**
   - Concerned with the physical connection between devices.
   - Defines characteristics of the hardware, such as cables, connectors, and transmission rates.
   - Transmission of raw binary data over a physical medium.

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**
   - Manages the physical addressing of devices using MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.
   - Responsible for error detection and correction at the bit level.
   - Divided into two sub-layers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC).

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3):**
   - Focuses on logical addressing and routing of data between devices on different networks.
   - Key protocols include IP (Internet Protocol).
   - Responsible for packet forwarding, addressing, and routing.

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4):**
   - Manages end-to-end communication and ensures data integrity and reliability.
   - Key protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
   - Provides error detection, flow control, and retransmission of lost or corrupted data.

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5):**
   - Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications.
   - Synchronizes data exchange and manages dialog control.

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6):**
   - Concerned with the format and syntax of data exchanged between applications.
   - Responsible for data compression, encryption, and translation between different data formats.

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7):**
   - Represents the interface between the network and the software applications.
   - Provides network services directly to end-users.
   - Includes protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and FTP.
